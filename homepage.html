        This wedding season we’re celebrating the girls who run the show, the bride’s forever tribe, the I-Do-Crew! Whether you’re her right hand in charge of all the plans, the party starter who sorts the tunes and the booze, or the fashionista of the group, our bridesmaid edit has hand-picked styles curated specially for you!A clothes shop or clothes store is any shop which sells items of ready-made clothing.[1]: 59  A small shop which sells expensive or designer clothing may be called a boutique. A shop that sells clothes for a narrowly-restricted market such as school uniforms or outdoor sports may be called an outfitter.
