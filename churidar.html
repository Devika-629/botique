    <h2><em>CHURIDAR</em></h2>
        <p>
  	Churidars, also churidar pyjamas, are tightly fitting trousers worn by both men and women in South Asia.[1] Churidars are a variant of the common shalwar pants. Shalwars are cut wide at the top and narrow at the ankle. Churidars narrow more quickly so that contours of the legs are revealed. They are usually cut on the bias, making them naturally stretchy. Stretch is important when pants are closefitting. They are also longer than the leg and sometimes finish with a tightly fitting buttoned cuff at the ankle.<br />
